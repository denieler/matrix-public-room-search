        "topic": "Wilkommen bei Sharing is Caring! - In unserer Gesellschaft ist die Verwertungslogik und der Gedanke, allem einen Wert geben zu müssen und zu wollen, allgegenwärtig. Damit möchten wir brechen. Tauschlogikfrei heißt zu Teilen des Teilens wegen, zu schenken des Schenkens wegen und zu bekommen, wenn ich etwas benötige was gerade nicht gebraucht wird. Das bedeutet, dass wir keine Verkaufsangebote und keine profitgetriebenen Posts möchten und akzeptieren. Es geht um das Teilen, Verschenken, die gegenseitige Hilfe, Veranstaltungstipps und ähnliches. Für kommerzielle Angebote gibt es eBay Kleinanzeigen und Co.  - Die Admins achten auf die Einhaltung der Regeln, löschen unerwünschte Beiträge und dürfen auch Menschen herauswerfen, die sich nicht an die Regeln halten.  - Diskussionen und Zweiergespräche dürfen nicht über die Gruppe geführt werden, das nervt nur alle anderen. Wer Interesse an etwas hat, meldet sich per Persönlicher Nachricht (PN) bei der Person. Über Gruppenbelange darf und muss natürlich diskutiert werden. Am besten wird das Angebot gelöscht, sobald es überholt ist, oder zumindest mit einem entsprechenden Kommentar versehen, um weitere Anfragen zu vermeiden.  - Die Gruppe ist für alle offen und soll einen Gegenpol zur von Tauschlogik und Kapitalismus geprägten Welt darstellen. Wir wollen diese Utopie zusammen ausprobieren, uns solidarisch unterstützen und anderen mit unbenutzten Gegenständen eine Freude machen. Let's spread love and solidarity. :heart:  - Rechtes Gedankengut sowie sämtliche Arten von Diskriminierung werden in keinster Art geduldet. Auch Verschwörungsmythen haben hier keinen Platz.  - Das ist keine Dating-Gruppe! Seht davon ab, andere Mitglieder dieser Gruppe ohne Kontext anzuschreiben, wenn ihr nicht sicher seid, dass das die andere Person auch möchte. Belästigungen haben in dieser Gruppe keinen Platz und haben einen Ausschluss aus der Gruppe zur Folge! Sexuelle Belästigung ist eine Straftat und kann (und sollte!) angezeigt werden. Solltest du Betroffene*r einer unangenehmen Situation sein, melde dich bitte bei den Admins! Betroffene sollten aus der Gruppe die größtmögliche Unterstützung und Solidarität erfahren.  - Alkoholhaltige Lebensmittel dürfen an Menschen über 18 verschenkt werden. Bitte denkt aber vorher darüber nach, ob es für euch zum \"Caring\"-Gedanken gehört, anderen Menschen unterschätzte Drogen zu schenken!

        "topic": "Welcome to Spite. We are a security and privacy-focused community dedicated to providing accurate information on how to protect your digital life based on scientific research and logical arguments. We are interested in the research, discussion, and education of privacy and security, as well as its impact on everyday life. In the interest of privacy, Spite is configured to be fully ephemeral and all chat content is erased every month; however, do not expect this to be fool-proof, as any member of this chat is able to log messages themselves. Anyone is welcome, but we expect you to be aware of and abide by the following rules:\n\n1) Don't be fallacious or bigoted\n\nIf anyone is engaging in a conversation with you whilst disagreeing with whichever viewpoint, surmise or opinion you happen to have, please maintain rationality and open-mindedness as opposed to resorting to FUD, misrepresentations, etc. Use logically sound arguments instead of common fallacies.\n\n2) Avoid inaccurate echo chambers\n\nDon't treat your conjectures as factual information no matter how verisimilar they may seem. Fact-check what you're about to say before saying it, or inquire for chat's input on your conjecture. Avoid linking inaccurate sources; if a source supports your narrative, but you're unsure of the incisiveness, please express so. We do not scold heavily for unintentional inaccuracy unless it becomes repetitive.\n\n3) Refrain from super off-topic discussion\n\nTopics that have completely nothing to do with anything, are not necessary, and drag on for too long are usually discouraged — unless there's minimal chat activity and they are enthralling. However, if it does not fit those qualifications and becomes continuous, you are in violation of this rule. Common offenders are unending political discussions or excessive shitposting. Humour is permitted, but only when it doesn't derail the chat.\n\n4) Don't be abusive or discriminatory\n\nPersonal attacks of any type are not tolerated. Do not insult or discriminate others based on race, sex, religion, gender / gender identity, sexual orientation, etc. Refrain from being hostile or disrespectful when discussing with people.\n\n5) No NSFW content\n\nPornography, gore, or any other NSFW content is not permitted here.\n\n6) No spamming or flooding\n\nThis is obvious.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nCommunity resources:\n\nhttps://qua3k.github.io/\nhttps://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/\nhttps://palone.blog/\nhttps://wonderfall.dev/\nhttps://seirdy.one/\n\nSpitetech Matrix Space: #spitetech-community:matrix.org\nOff-topic: #spitetech-offtopic:matrix.org",

        "topic": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware ••• We can work towards more open hardware.  Reverse Engineering or hacking existing things is good if legal.  The world is a better place because of of what lead to OpenWRT (but software focus is in other rooms).  I see there is now OpenWiFi on FGPAs, et cetera, no chipset yet.  Adding hardware for such on exsisting devices would be great. ••• Don't do \"Hi-Hello Ping-Pong\" in here, or anything superfluous, OUTSIDE of TOPICAL messages.  If you want to sit in a circle, introducing yourselves, go join Alcohol Anonymous!!! ••• It is the responsibility of people posting i.e. links, to make certain such is in good faith believed to be topical, and for the poster to summarize and explain why it's topical.  Otherwise Mod's may summarily remove such posts at their discretion. • This is NOT a General Chat.  ° No need to introduce yourself, nor greet others; whereas \"lurking\"/idling is fine. - Go fill the scrollback with hi-hello ping-pong somewhere else like what has been the cesspit of #offtopic:matrix.org . Put your greetings within a topical message! — https://www.nohello.com/?m=0 — Such is not part of room norm's. Expression of gratitude IS part of the room norm' culture we foster, to re-normalize such. Reactions are generally okay, but no standalone greetings. ° And in i.e. our Tech' Rooms, the \"brb\" thing is NOT okay, nor letting us know of your status in a room message, nor changing your Display Name to show you are eating a piece of toast in a urinal.  Basically NO ONE CARES, it's orthogonal/unrelated to whatever you are asking and doesn't help you solve that problem, plus just annoyingly wastes our time so we're less likely to answer!  Matrix has improved things from 1988 when IRC is said to have been incepted.  If you are in a room, you won't miss what happened when you are offline (unless you have an E2EE problem).  So don't announce you are /away.  But if you think you must,Matrix already has a Custom Status Message, shown i.e. in the userlist/memberlist, on Element-web, click your Avatar next to the textbox/textarea.  Use THAT instead, for anyone who might care.  There needs to be a modern Matrix update, but the concept has been around for a while: https://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/away.html ° \"Don't ask to ask! Just ask.\" https://dontasktoask.com • It's just noise in the signal-to-noise thing and off-topic clutter in the scroll-back that serves no purpose in helping people help each other find answers. • Don't bring us some supposed solution and expect us to make it fit your problem. See: The XY Problem http://xyproblem.info/ ° Again, this just leads to BULLSHIT screen-clutter and useless chat. • Also, do not send new-messages in rapid-fire race-to-send IRC-style before finishing a thought. Your BFF-Jill is NOT in here. And EDIT instead of sending new- correction messages. If you would rather be on IRC, no one is stopping you. Edit, and on desktop/laptop/et cetera, use <shift>+<enter> instead of sending, and set the mobile client to not send on <enter>. CONSOLIDATE instead of leaving 30 messages in the scrollback, where 1 would do just fine.  Practice sending well formed messages, or editing, in some other room, making your own if need be.  Some have used #test:matrix.org but do NOT play with your \"shiny new thing\" up in here!!! See Also, i.e. item 2, here: https://pics.me.me/annoying-typing-habits-i-l337-speak-2-enter-key-h3110-11638212.png • DNF(t)T/DNFtT/DNFT!!!  Nod's gon' Thanos (wipe away without a trace) the sockpuppeting trolls, at their earliest convenience.  Adding to the drama they bring makes you part of the trollfest problem, and maybe a co-conspirator to be Thanos-ed.  We are Moderators.  Expect us. ••• In rooms with RSS/Atom Feeds, the RSS 'Bot may provide very helpful info' at times, and offer discussion starters. We Mod's do not care if you dislike them. Disregard or /ignore them if you must. But no unappreciative, disruptive, malcontent Concern Troll FUD meta-chat (chat about the chat) is allowed; you can LEAVE and join the cesspit of #offtopic:matrix.org !!! • It is polite to ASK in the room BEFORE inviting someone into a Direct Chat Message. This is EXPECTED before inviting Mod's, and futile AFTER being banned. Can't behave in the room, we won't waste our time in an individual temper-tantrum time-out hand-holding fidget-spinner participation-trophy session.

        "topic": "Scuttlebutt is the general idea or concept around all of this. It's definition is loose, and is often just meant to refer to this entire thing, in the way someone refers to \"the internet\" or \"this afternoon\". In this case, the thing is the idea of a network organized similar to an actual social graph, which communicates messages in a way similar to gossip.\n\nSSB stands for SecureScuttleButt. It is the protocol through which we can exchange messages, read each others' feeds, and make friends. You could compare it to TCP, which is an underlying protocol for how devices connect to one another on the internet. TCP is a network protocol, though, while SSB is a local protocol. This means it doesn't require any sort of internet connection to work.\n\nPatchwork,Patchbay, and Patchfoo are different applications used to interpret and display the various messages transmitted through SSB. A rough analogy would be that if SSB was like TCP, then an application like Patchwork would be like a web browser.\n\nA better analogy for all of this would be that Patchwork is a car you ride in and SecureScuttlebutt is the road you drive on. There are other types of cars that drive on the same road and you can drive a different car to the same place (car = application, road = protocol).\n+\n\nhttps://www.scuttlebutt.nz/",

Slurs and friendly banter allowed, don't be a sensitive little bitch.\n[4] Don't post pornographic or gory (NSFW) media unless it's relevant to an on-topic conversation.\n[5] If one topic gets brought up over and over again to the point where it gets boring, it might temporarily get banned.

Forum Fimbriarum is the successor of the Debate & Philosophy room, which was discontinued in May 2024.\n\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ Element desktop will show this description without formatting. Join the space for formatted info: #forumfimbriarum:deadchild.fokk.in\n\nRULES:\n\nThis room is meant to be a mixed bag of thought without moral limits. Therefore:\n\n[1] Don't try to silence or cancel people for promoting things you find immoral (LGBTQ+, Nazism, pedophilia, Judaism, nationalism, etc).\n[2] Don't try to silence or cancel people for perceived lack of quality (too dumb, too autistic, driven by schizophrenia, etc). \n[3] Don't direct hate or inappropriate amounts of anger towards a room member. Slurs and friendly banter allowed, don't be a sensitive little bitch.\n[4] Don't post pornographic or gory (NSFW) media unless it's relevant to an on-topic conversation.\n[5] If one topic gets brought up over and over again to the point where it gets boring, it might temporarily get banned. Current banned topics: none.\n[!] #d:deadchild.fokk.in space rules apply as well (no doxxing, no CP, no organizing violent/sexual crimes, no hacking/messing with people's computers.)\n\nTLDR: Share cool stuff, be nice, don't claim moral authority over others.",

We have barely just started development. We are not affiliated to neither Xubuntu, Ubuntu or Linux Mint so any support questions or/and or complaints you may have should be directed at us, not Ubuntu, Xubuntu or Linux Mint, and we ask you kindly that you respect this.\n\nWe have added a lot of high quality software to make it real easy to get started working on your photographs. We have also done a few underlying tweaks to make it work better for a photographers workflow. We are adding more of our own packages weekly to our OS. You can find those packages in our PPA repo and they are prefixed as focuspoint- (with exception of a few non focuspoint packages) to make them easy to find.",

By analyzing the graph, we can identify the best time to invest and how much to invest. For instance, we can use this information to determine where the reddest shirts and green shirts are being sold, and calculate the most suitable location for our investment. If you live in a place with all four seasons, you can send sweaters and coats for the winter and t-shirts, tank tops, and sandals for the summer. To maximize profits, you can also analyze the biorhythm of a product or content to determine its demand, sales, and how long it sold in a given period, considering natural disasters, mother earth, or human nature.",

We're also mainly focused on helping men but if you are a different gender who seeks therapy then you may dm me at @ruby-w-:bark.lgbt (No asking needed just dm me and state that you want someone to talk to).\n\nIf you are a man who doesn't want to be around women for any reason, I plan on having someone make a group for men only. If you'd like to volunteer to start this room go ahead. Until then, feel free to ask other men for permission to dm them about your issues. \n\nMAPs, creeps, and other nuisances will be banned. There's no place for them here. Loopholes will either be ignored or fixed.\n\nOverall, this is a safe place and I'd like to keep it that way. If you have questions dm me at @ruby-w-:bark.lgbt.",
